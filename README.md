# SpoiledApples
Artificial intelligence (AI) has already proved to be practically useful for resolving global technological and social issues. Its implementation in the precision agriculture domain has become very popular recently as it increases the quantitative and the qualitative indicators of food production thus yielding huge economic benefits. AI can be also used to keep the harvest in good condition by analyzing postharvest losses. Here we present a dataset (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YzSQq65des9Ldku-QyXi2SnUhfEfRTsi?usp=sharing) containing RGB images of apples. The images for dataset were acquired by author himself using digital RGB camera mounted on custom-made testbed. Some apples here have spoiled (decay) areas. It is possible to see the growth of spoiled areas in apples via series of images.
