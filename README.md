Artificial intelligence can be appled to the vatiety range of the tasks and now it is possible to run it on a low-power embedded systems and can be applied for detecting of the seed germination dynamics. The proposed approach has an industrial impact as a powerful tool for assessing the performance of growing systems and prediction of their future harvesting period. At the same time, it provides an opportunity for making optimization at the initial stage of plant growth. This optimization will further result in the optimal management of resources in the context of precision agriculture. For implementing the proposed approach we collected the dataset which contains the sequentially time-ordered images of seedsgermination process at different stages.
